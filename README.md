# okta-aws-go

# Thanks
This is heavily based on these 2 great projects:
- https://github.com/nimbusscale/okta_aws_login
- https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-aws-cli-assume-role

I recreated it for 2 reasons, first I wanted something more portable and I'm always looking for good reasons to learn Go
